a) I aspire to become better computer science, coding and competitive programming. I always love to learn new things and make new friends. I can make flexible 
   decisions to manage time between college work and practicing coding languages. I developed an ability to able to work for long hours. I also love to work in teams and
   I have good communication skills. I joined amritapuri branch for amFOSS and I would totally love to be a part of this club. 
b) My plan for the next 6 months is to become stronger in python, java, c/c++ and other languages I might require and also to learn and work more in linux. I will learn 
   more about developing open sources software and will try and do my best to become a contributing memeber to the club.
c) I will try and make friends in the club and help them with their work and make good relationships with my mentors and approach them for my doubts. And when it is my
   time to mentor juniors, I will make sure they'll love this club. I will try and learn whatever I can and give as much as possible back to the club.
d) The recruitment process is really good! The tasks given really make us search google for stuff and browse on some websites for any downloads or doubts. The seniors 
   were very interactive with the new comers and always welcomed us to ask doubts or share progress. The time given for the tasks was also sufficiently good. I would 
   give a 10 to the selection process by you guys.
