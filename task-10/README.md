This task was very interesting and very knowledge providing. I could find few references like using 'ls' and all because I did task-14 before this. I also had an issue as I copy-pasted the amFOSS tasks file on to my computer and the links didnt come with them, so I watched 4 of 2019's cs50 lectures. So when I contacted my senior about the link for problem sets I realised this mistake. When I looked at week 2 problem set, I saw Caeser Cipher in Crypto and I knew this before as I learned it while doing one of the bios tasks. Unfortunately I didnt manage my time properly and couldnt finish this task.
